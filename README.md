# Functional and Logic Programming 23/24

This repository contains the practical assignments for the Functional and Logic Programming course at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) in the 2023/24 academic year. 

Each folder (tp1 and tp2) contains the details and source code related to each of the practical assignments.

## Board game in Prolog ([TP1](tp1))

**Theme chosen:** [Tactigon](https://tactigongame.com/)

**Description:** The aim of the project was to create a board game for two players that allows three game modes: Human vs Human, Human vs Computer and Computer vs Computer. The computer has two levels, with level 1 making moves at random and level 2 evaluating the best move from a given position using a MiniMax algorithm.

**Grade obtained:** 18.85/20

## Haskell compiler for an imperative programming language ([TP2](tp2))

**Description:** The objective of this project is to develop a Haskell compiler for a small imperative programming language. The language encompasses arithmetic and boolean expressions, assignments, sequences of statements, if-then-else statements, and while loops. Our compiler needs to translate programs in this imperative language into lists of instructions for a low-level machine. The implementation includes data types for instructions, arithmetic and boolean expressions, and statements. Additionally, we need to provide functions for compiling expressions and statements, as well as a parser to transform imperative programs from strings into their corresponding data representation. The goal is to generate executable code for a low-level machine from high-level imperative programs.

**Grade obtained:** ?/20
